LuaJIT experimental
-------------------
Mostly 5.2 complete, with bits of 5.3.

No handholding, here be dragons ahead. This is a fork tracks Mike's bleeding
edge repo, and then adds its own fragile hacks on top of it.

There are no releases planned as of yet - development, testing, deployment all
happens in rolling fashion from git head (with reverts to put out inevitable
occasional fires). Users are expected to be at least capable of git bisect.

Definitely not for the faint of heart, especially if you're looking for
"stable 5.2 Luajit" to ship with your product.
